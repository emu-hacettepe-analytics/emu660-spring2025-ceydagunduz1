# 1. Project Overview and Scope

> Energy production and consumption are among the primary drivers of climate change, as they are major sources of carbon emissions. The continuous rise in energy demand, fueled by economic growth and industrialization, directly accelerates carbon emissions. In this study, we aim to investigate the relationship between energy consumption and carbon emissions originating from the energy sector in Turkey over the years.
>
> First, correlation and regression analyses will be conducted to reveal the linear relationship between energy consumption and carbon emissions. Then, time series analysis will be applied to evaluate the trends of emissions and energy consumption over the years, the sectoral distribution of carbon emissions from the energy sector will also be examined, with a particular focus on emissions from electricity generation due to its dominant share.\

## 2.2 General Information About Data

The data obtained from TÜİK provide information on the sectoral distribution of carbon emissions in Türkiye over the years, as well as GDP figures necessary for calculating energy intensity. Additionally, the data gathered from the IEA include Türkiye's total primary energy supply, annual energy amounts by source, energy-related carbon emissions, the carbon intensity of the energy mix, per capita carbon emissions, electricity generation and consumption figures, and the share of renewable energy sources in electricity generation.

## 2.3 Reason of Choice

This study has been selected with the aim of contributing to sustainable development goals in line with energy and climate policies.\
In order to shed light on the extent to which carbon-free growth is achievable and how Turkey's trends over the years align with these goals, this topic has been chosen from the perspectives of energy, environment, and society, particularly given that energy-related emissions constitute a major portion of global warming.\
Raising awareness on this issue is also one of the primary motivations behind the study.

We have converted the data to R data format for processing.

```{r}
save(Co2_emissions_by_sector, Co2_emissions_fuel_combustion, Co2_emissions_per_cap, electricity_cons_per_cap, electricity_final_consumption,electricity_generation_sources, renewables, electricity_production, gdp_per_capita, emissions_by_sector, emissions, file="emissions.RData")
```

Our common column across the datasets is the year variable. In order to merge the datasets by year, we needed to convert the year columns to a single data type. Therefore, the year values were converted to "integer" format.

```{r}
gdp_per_capita$Year <- as.integer(gdp_per_capita$Year)
Co2_emissions_by_sector$Year <- as.integer(Co2_emissions_by_sector$Year)
Co2_emissions_fuel_combustion$Year <- as.integer(Co2_emissions_fuel_combustion$Year)
Co2_emissions_per_cap$Year <- as.integer(Co2_emissions_per_cap$Year)
electricity_cons_per_cap$Year <- as.integer(electricity_cons_per_cap$Year)
electricity_final_consumption$Year <- as.integer(electricity_final_consumption$Year)
electricity_generation_sources$Year <- as.integer(electricity_generation_sources$Year)
electricity_production$Year <- as.integer(electricity_production$Year)
emissions <- emissions |> mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))
emissions_by_sector$Year <- as.integer(emissions_by_sector$Year)
renewables$Year <- as.integer(renewables$Year)
```

We merged multiple tables to be used in the analysis by using the year column as the common key.

```{r}
#sektör bazlı/grup olmayanları masterdataya ekledim.
yil_ortakli <- gdp_per_capita |>
  left_join(Co2_emissions_fuel_combustion, by="Year") |>

  left_join(renewables, by="Year") 

yil_ortakli <- yil_ortakli |> mutate(Year = ifelse(is.na(Year), 2024, Year))

# 3. Analysis

In the first stage of this section, exploratory data analysis was conducted to better understand the details of the data. The datasets prepared for the analysis were visualized to make them interpretable and suitable for drawing insights. After understanding the data details and their relationships, time series and regression analyses were applied to make predictions about CO2 emissions.

## 3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

When examining the change in CO2 emissions over the years, an increasing trend is observed. Population growth also plays a role in this rise.

Emissions from the electricity sector have increased significantly, reaching the highest levels among all sectors. This is followed by the transportation and industry sectors, both with high emission values. Emissions related to the residential sector have increased at a slower pace. Emission values in other sectors remain relatively low.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
Co2_emissions_by_sector |> ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=Year, y=Value, color=`CO2 emissions by sector`)) + ylab("Value of Co2 emissions") + ggtitle("CO2 Emissions by Sector Over the Years") + theme_minimal() + theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)), 
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)),  
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 7)
  )
```

We observe that the industrial sector is the largest consumer of electricity. The residential and commercial sectors also have high levels of electricity consumption. In recent years, with the increasing use of electric vehicles, small increases have been observed in the transportation sector. In contrast, almost no increase has been seen in the agriculture and fisheries sectors. The low electricity consumption in these two sectors despite population growth may indicate a decline in their operational capacity.

```{r}
electricity_final_consumption |> ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=Year, y=Value/10^3,color =`Electricity final consumption (TJ)`)) + ggtitle("Electricty Final Consumption Over the Years")+ theme_minimal() + theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)), 
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)),  
    legend.position = "right",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 7)
  )
```

The annual distribution of energy sources used for electricity generation has changed as follows:

```{r}
#install.packages("plotly")
#install.packages("streamgraph")
#install.packages("ggstream")
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggstream)
library(streamgraph)
library(plotly)


kaynak_tipi <- read_csv("C:/GitHub/emu660-spring2025-ceydagunduz1/project_data/International Energy Agency - electricity generation sources in Turkiye.csv")

wide_format <- kaynak_tipi %>% 
  group_by(Year, kaynak = `electricity generation sources in Turkiye`) %>%
  summarise(toplam = sum(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%  
  pivot_wider(names_from = kaynak, values_from = toplam)

long_data <- wide_format %>%
  pivot_longer(-Year, names_to = "Sector", values_to = "gwh") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  mutate(yuzde = gwh/sum(gwh, na.rm=TRUE) * 100) 

aa <- plot_ly(long_data, x = ~Sector, 
              y = ~yuzde, 
              frame = ~Year, 
              type = 'bar',
              color = ~Sector)

aa
```

The percentage change in emissions by sector is as follows:

```{r}
emissions_by_sector <-yil_ortakli |> group_by(Year) |> pivot_longer(cols = Energy:Waste,
                            names_to = "Emissions_sector",
                            values_to = "Emission_Value") |> mutate(Percentage = Emission_Value/sum(Value)*100)

plot_ly(emissions_by_sector,
        labels = ~Emissions_sector,
        values = ~Emission_Value,
        frame = ~Year,
        type = 'pie',
        textinfo = 'percent',
        insidetextorientation = 'radial')
```

Strong correlation results have shown that as the population increases, CO₂ emissions from fuel sources also rise. Additionally, as per capita electricity consumption increases, per capita CO₂ emissions also increase. A strong positive relationship has been observed between electricity generation and economic growth (GDP).

The share of renewable energy sources has not shown a directly negative relationship with other variables in the system at this stage. This may be due to its relatively low share in total energy usage.

```{r}
#install.packages("ggcorrplot")
library(ggcorrplot)
veri <- yil_ortakli[,c("mid_year_population",
                      "value_usd",
                      "CO2 emissions from fuel combustion",
                      "CO2 emissions per capita",
                      "Electricity consumption per capita (MWh)",
                      "Total electricity production (GWh)",
                      "Renewables share of electricity generation (%)")] 

core_1 <-cor(veri, use="complete.obs")


eksen_isim <- c("Population","GDP","CO2 From Fuel","CO2 Per Capita","Electricity Use Per Capita", "Electricity Production Total","Renewables Share Electricity")

colnames(core_1) <- eksen_isim
rownames(core_1) <- eksen_isim

ggcorrplot(core_1,lab=T,lab_size=3,type="lower",tl.cex=8,tl.srt=45) 

```

The heatmap below shows the correlations between per capita CO₂ emissions and electricity generation sources. The graph indicates a very high correlation coefficient between coal and CO₂ emissions, suggesting that coal use in electricity production is one of the main contributors to the increase in emissions. Renewable sources such as wind, geothermal, and hydro also show a positive correlation. However, this may not be due to their direct contribution to emissions, but rather because their increasing share in electricity production coincides with an overall rise in total generation and emissions. A negative correlation is observed for oil (r = –0.88). Since oil has a relatively small share in electricity production, its reduction has little effect on decreasing total emissions.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)

co2 <- Co2_emissions_per_cap
elec <- electricity_generation_sources

elec_wide <- elec |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Electricity generation sources (GWh)`,

core_2 <- yil_ortakli_2 %>%
